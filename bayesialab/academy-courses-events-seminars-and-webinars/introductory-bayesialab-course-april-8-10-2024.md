# ðŸŽ“ Introductory BayesiaLab Course â€” April 8â€“10, 2024

### Three-Day Introductory BayesiaLab Course&#x20;

The Graduate Cincinnati, 151 Goodman Drive,  Cincinnati, Ohio 45219\
April 8â€“10, 2024

Since 2009, our BayesiaLab courses and events have spanned the globe. From New York to Sydney, Paris to Singapore, we've touched down in cities worldwide (take a peek at our [photo gallery](https://lightroom.adobe.com/shares/3034ac3a449c4b0d95f4e154d81a6c08)!).&#x20;

We're excited to launch our 2024 course program at The Graduate Cincinnati. Located at the heart of the vibrant University of Cincinnati campus, this former Marriott Kingsgate Conference Center has been transformed with an 'upscale funky' vibe.&#x20;

The Introductory BayesiaLab Course is more than just a beginner's guide. It's a deep dive into applying Bayesian networks across diverse fields, from marketing science and econometrics to ecology and sociology. And we don't just stick to theory. Every conceptual lesson transitions seamlessly into hands-on practice with BayesiaLab, allowing you to apply what you've learned directly, whether in knowledge modeling, causal inference, machine learning, or more.

Over 1,500 researchers worldwide can vouch for its impact, many of whom have made Bayesian networks and BayesiaLab integral to their research. Don't just take our word for it - check out the [testimonials](introductory-bayesialab-course-april-8-10-2024.md#course-testimonials-2009-2023)!&#x20;

### About the Instructor

* Dr. Lionel Jouffe is co-founder and CEO of France-based Bayesia S.A.S. Lionel holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Rennes and has worked in Artificial Intelligence since the early 1990s. While working as a Professor/Researcher at ESIEA, Lionel started exploring the potential of Bayesian networks.
* After co-founding Bayesia in 2001, he and his team have been working full-time on the development of BayesiaLab, which has since emerged as the leading software package for knowledge discovery, data mining, and knowledge modeling using Bayesian networks. BayesiaLab enjoys broad acceptance in academic communities, business, and industry.
