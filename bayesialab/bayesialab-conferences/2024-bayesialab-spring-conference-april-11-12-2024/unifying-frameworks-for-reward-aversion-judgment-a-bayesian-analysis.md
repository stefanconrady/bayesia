# üá∫üá∏ Unifying Frameworks for Reward-Aversion Judgment: A Bayesian Analysis

To be presented at the [2024 BayesiaLab Spring Conference](./) in Cincinnati on April 11, 2024.

### Abstract

Using Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN), variables from three graphs based on Relative Preference Theory (RPT) were integrated. The graphs in RPT have analogies to known graphs in other frameworks for human judgment but are derived from the only framework tested and found to meet physics criteria for lawfulness. The graphs are analogous to those found in Prospect Theory, Markowitz portfolio theory, and the Payne, Bettman, and Johnson adaptive strategy selection. RPT produces nonlinear graphs with R2 fits per person, on average > 0.9. RPT graphs calibrate value based on patterns in prior judgments (value function), limits in risk-reward and risk-aversion relations (limit function), and balance between reward and aversion judgments (tradeoff function). Using the same picture rating task administered to three distinct internet cohorts, each with more than 3,000 subjects, graphs were observed calibrating reward/aversion value (value function), associating risk to reward/aversion (limit function), and balancing reward against aversion (tradeoff function). Fifteen mathematical features of these graphs based on engineering approaches or behavioral finance constructs, such as loss aversion and risk aversion, were computed and then used as input for Bayesian Belief Network analysis and correlational analysis to identify consistent relationships between these fifteen mathematical features. When consistent relationships were observed, we then fit mathematical functions to the combined dataset of 10,000+ subjects. This analysis showed that the calibration of value (prospect theory-like graph) anchors the relationship of risk-reward variables in a distinct manner from how it anchors the relationship of risk to aversion, and four distinct clusterings of these graph features can be observed based on their graph of origin with highly interpretable relationships. The fifteen graph features can be combined and applied to predict the outputs of human judgment using machine learning. Thus, it is possible to create an individual profile or ‚Äúfingerprint,‚Äù which can be used to predict behavior or other psychological conditions such as anxiety, depression, and suicidality. Marketers can use the features as a segmentation variable to identify the best prospects and design the most effective messages.

Hans C. Breiter, M.D., is a neuroimager, neuroscientist, and psychiatrist currently appointed as Professor of Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering in the College of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Cincinnati. Previously, he was a Professor at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, where he was also Director of the Warren Wright Adolescent Center. Prior to that, he was a Psychiatrist and Senior Investigator in Psychiatry at Mass General Research Institute and Harvard Medical School, where he still maintains an active adjunct position. He has received over $28M in federal research funding, has more than 20,000 citations in peer-reviewed publications, has published with three Nobel Laureates, and has started multiple scientific disciplines, including reward neuroimaging, psychiatric MRI-based morphometry, imaging omics, and multi-omics. His current work is focused on developing Comp Cog AI with close collaborators at Northwestern University.
